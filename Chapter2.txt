*Process Concept:-An abstraction og a running program.
"Resource Management"<---OS----> more than one program is currently running.

-Swapping between processes.
-Scopping:- 10ms or 100ms
-Architecture:-Impacts OS efficiency(It makes one OS from other)
-Process Control Block(PCB's)
*Data Structure that OS uses to keep track of each process.
*Swapping is Unpredicatable from the perspective of the program.
Scheduling:
->Trigger Rev
  -LACK OF RESOURCE
  -Priority
Process vs Program
-Process is a running program on the machine.
-Program is a series of instruction


Examples

Windows                                     Unix-related(OS)
Create Process                                BSD----(Max OS)
                                              Linux
                                              fork()(Keep track of parent and child process)
                                              (fork makes a copy of process and runs it)
Shell
->command,packages,flags[Fork execute]

Process States and Transition
1)ready State<-----------------------------
2)Running State------   <-----------|     |
                    | Request Resource    |
                    |                     |
3)Block state <------        --------------

Why Processes
-Because abstraction

Multiple processes are connected to a virtual CPU and the virtual CPU is connected to a CPU.
