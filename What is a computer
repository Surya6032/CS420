*Combination of cleverly connected switches.
*Vaccum tube:- Its a switch which is either on or off.  Its a electric switch.
*Transistor were used after vaccum tubes as switches as they are made in microscopic form.
*Transistors-> Gates(And,Or,Not,Xor)
*Adders-When you two 1/2 adders you get a complete adder(8 bit adder).
* Von Neuman Architecture- All modern machines are build using this architecture.

Operating system
* What is it?
->manage resources
Multi Processing
->program thats incharge of other programs and that is called operating system


OS provides layers of abstraction.

Computing metaphors:-
I)Resource Manager-> Appearance of multiprocessing
                      *more than one program "simultaneosly"
                      *Processor does one instruction at one time.
What Resource?
* Memory(as we don't have enough memory) <-------------------Loads and unloads as program becomes inactive
*Disks-Communication
Thread: Unit of computation processing
II) Bridge

End 1 <------------> End 2
       loop
Hardware <-------------> User Interface
-Has its own             C++
 language
  ->bits
 * Drivers are used to create a bridge between user interface and hardware
 
 
 Organization of OS's
 - 2 main components
 Kernel               User Space
 (defition read)      Non Priviliged   
 Priviliged
 And non priviliged
 
 Priviliged Instruction
 -> CPU instructions deals with
     -Device management
     -CPU registers(state)
     
 Interacting with an OS
 G.U.I's
 Command line
 
 Shell-Program that waits for command from the user-->for OS to processed
